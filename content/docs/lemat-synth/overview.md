LeMat-Synth is an extensible pipeline that parses scientific PDFs using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to produce structured, machine-readable records of material synthesis and performance.

## What you get

For each paper processed, LeMat-Synth outputs:

**Synthesised materials** — The actual materials fabricated in the paper, distinguished from materials merely cited or compared against.

**Structured procedures** — Step-by-step synthesis recipes including reagents with amounts and purity, temperatures, durations, and atmospheres.

**Performance data** — Quantitative values extracted from figures in the paper using VLM technology, including axis labels and plot coordinates.

**Quality scores** — An LLM-based rating across five dimensions to indicate extraction confidence.

A typical output record looks like this:

```json
{
  "material": "Ru/MgO(110)",
  "synthesis_method": "wet impregnation",
  "reagents": [
    {"name": "RuCl3", "amount": "0.15 g", "purity": "99.9%"}
  ],
  "steps": [
    {"description": "Dissolve precursor in water", "temperature": "25°C", "duration": "30 min"},
    {"description": "Impregnate support", "atmosphere": "N2"},
    {"description": "Calcine", "temperature": "500°C", "duration": "4 h", "atmosphere": "air"}
  ],
  "performance": {
    "metric": "NH3 conversion",
    "value": 78.5,
    "unit": "%",
    "conditions": "400°C"
  },
  "quality_scores": {
    "completeness": 0.9,
    "consistency": 0.85
  }
}
```

## How it works

The pipeline has four composable components:

1. **PlotFilterConfig** — Screens figures by axis labels and units to identify relevant performance plots (e.g., `"Temperature"` × `"Conversion %"`).
2. **Material Extraction Prompts** — LLM instructions for identifying domain-specific materials from text.
3. **Optional Metric Extractors** — Text-based or vision-based scalar extraction (e.g., bandgap, onset voltage, critical temperature).
4. **Output Writers** — JSON or CSV serialisation with custom schemas.

## Scale and coverage

The LeMat-Synth v1.0 dataset was built from over **80,000 open-access papers** and covers:

- **35 synthesis methods** — including wet impregnation, sol-gel, chemical vapour deposition, hydrothermal synthesis, and more
- **16 material classes** — oxides, nitrides, carbides, MOFs, zeolites, perovskites, and others
- Three fully worked case studies: thermocatalysis, superconductors, and porous materials
